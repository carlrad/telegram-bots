Implement the agent class extending the base Agent class
Register the agent in agents/__init__.py

### IDEAS ###

1. Agent to help with company financial research. It should search the web for official 
financial sources and pull these together into a useful summary to show headline performance.
As an additional step, it should monitor companies I follow on companies house and notify me when
a company I follow has uploaded financial statements to companies house along with a simple summary
2. Agent to help with UK and US tax returns. Would need access to google drive and docs inc. 
pdfs to read and help me structure my return
3. Training agents to help with cycling and climbing
